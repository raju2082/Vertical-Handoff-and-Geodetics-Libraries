Calculating distance b/w two lat longs:

Three formulae are given.

I) Haversine Formula:  
	This formula calculates the great-circle distance between two points – that is, 
the shortest distance over the earth’s surface – given ‘as-the-crow-flies’ distance 
between the points (ignoring any hills, of course!).
	Haversine calculations are done on the basis of a spherical earth.

II) Arada's Formula: This formula is taken from Vincenty's calculations. but to the point 
that the calculations are based on ellipsoidal earth. 

III) Spherical Law of cosines: 
	In haversine formula, computational precision was limited. The simple spherical 
law of cosines formula (cos c = cos a cos b + sin a sin b cos C) gives well-conditioned 
results down to distances as small as around 1 metre.
